		<release version="V.0.2.2" date="2021-03-08">
			<description>
				<ul>

			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>The Launcher distributables are now named "Nexus-LU-Launcher" instead of "NLUL.GUI".</li>
					<li>Added support for changing the client download location by setting NLULHome in your system environment.</li>
					<li>Currently, this will create a .nlul directory in the specified home. This will change in the next release to use the directory directly. No action will be required on update, but the files will move up 1 directory.</li>
					<li>Added verification that the client is extracted correctly. This should resolve white screens on launch.</li>
					<li>Added Auto TCP/UDP patch option. TCP/UDP is still an option, but Auto TCP/UDP is default now.</li>
					<li>Auto TCP/UDP will attempt to enable or disable the TCP/UDP patch depending on the server being connected to. This should allow for connecting to servers that use TCP/UDP, like Uchu servers, as well as servers that don't, like OpCrux and WLUS, without having to change anything manually. Installs with older versions will still use TCP/UDP unless you go to the Patches tab, uninstall TCP/UDP, and install Auto TCP/UDP.</li>
					<li>Fixed crash on download error.</li>
					<li>Fixed patches showing as uninstalled after downloading the client.</li>
					<li>Fixed closing the window now stopping the download.</li>

					<li>The Linux and macOS builds are compiled on Linux and will have the correct file permissions for executing. No additional commands are required before running.</li>
					<li>Nexus LU Launcher's macOS build is now packaged as an app instead of ZIP with the executables and libraries. The CLI has not changed.</li>
					<li>The macOS build now automatically installs WINE since the WINE setup is more complicated due to macOS Catalina and newer not working with the old 32-bit WINE builds. If wine is in your PATH, it will override this. If wine isn't working, such as an old build from a pre-Catalina install, the game will not launch.</li>
					<li>The ZIP version of the client is no longer saved after being used. This file is >4GB.</li>
					<li>Updated Uchu's default setup for the CLI. dev is used by default instead of master. Redis is now disabled by default. SQLite is now used by default, as part of the current dev build of Uchu. PostgreSQL is not checked or used by default. .NET 5.0 is now used by default.</li>
					<li>Fix the server list entries having a gap on the right when the scroll bar isn't present.</li>
